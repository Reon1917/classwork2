                            <p>Lady Jessica Atreides is Paul's mother. She was raised in the ways of the Bene Gesserit, and trains Paul in their powerful, mystic ways. Duke Leto Atreides is Paul's father. He serves as a role model to Paul, a noble man who tries to do what is right.</p>

                            <p>Coming from Chakobsa, the term "Kwisatz Haderach" literally translates to "Shortening of the Way." The Way is a reference to the "Weirding Way," a Bene Gesserit-developed combat technique that requires mastery of mind and body.</p>

                            <p>Referenced many times in the movie the phrase "As it was written was" said by many characters when Paul achieved things propograted by the Missionaria Protectiva (The Missionaria Protectiva was the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood's "black arm of superstition", responsible for sowing the seeds of superstition in primitive cultures, so that the Sisterhood could take advantage of them when those seeds grew to full-fledged legends.)</p>
